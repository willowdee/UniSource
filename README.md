# Copilot
This project and most of it's code was written by Github Copilot! Even this document.
# Support
While in active development, it's still heavily lacking in features. If you have any suggestions, please let me know!
Also, you can support me on [Patreon](http://www.blankwebsite.com/) if you want to help me out.
